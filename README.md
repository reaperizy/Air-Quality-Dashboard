# How to Run Streamlit Dashboard

This serves as a concise manual for operating the Streamlit dashboard. Ensure that you've installed all necessary libraries prior to launching the application. The ipynb file can be disregarded, as it was exclusively utilized for thorough data cleaning and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) before constructing the data dashboard.

## Install Dependencies

To set up the essential libraries, access your terminal/command prompt, go to the project directory, and execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
